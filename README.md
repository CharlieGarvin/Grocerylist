# Grocerylist
Java 1400 final project

## Description
This app is a grocery store that runs through the terminal allowing you to add, remove, and display the total amount of items in your cart with the price. When you add an item to your cart it will ask how many of the items you would like to add. When you remove an item it will ask you how many of the selected items you would like to remove. When you choose to display the total amount of items in your cart it will also calculate the total of the items in your cart as well.
